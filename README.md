# CLIP-qlr
QGIS Layer Style Files (.qlr) for the Florida Critical Lands and Waters Identification Project (CLIP). Raw data is in GeoTiff format projected in EPSG:6439 - NAD83(2011) Florida GDL Albers. The data is made available by the Florida Natural Areas Inventory (FNAI) in ESRI File Geodatabase format with ArcGIS Layer files included <http://fnai.org/clip.cfm>. These files are not accessible within QGIS. I am providing the raster files and styling files to make conservation planning more accessible to an open source software user.
